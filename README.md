To make it work

Server side: where it says "change to IP of server", change 127.0.0.1 to the IPv4 address of the computer you are running the code on. 

Client side: where it says "change to IP of server", change 127.0.0.1 to the IPv4 address of the computer that the server code is running on. 

Once the server code is running without any errors, run the client code on another PC, join a server in the cmd prompt, repeat on a different computer, and now you're having a text chat.
